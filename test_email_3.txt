Hey bros,

Setup will run from 7-9PM. 17s and 18s if you are not going to make it send me an email explaining your conflict by 11:59PM Thursday or you will be getting a $25 fine.

To get ready for our party we're going to have a party policies refresher at 9PM to remind everyone and to train the 19s. If you're on duty Friday make sure you come.

Also, seriously, sign up for duties. If you haven't signed up for at least 5/7 of your duties by 11:59PM Thursday expect a $25 fine. Also if there are unfilled spots for any event in the future at T minus 12 hours, I will assign people that are low on signup count, and they will not be getting credit. Check the count tab to confirm that you've signed up for the number you think you have.

Fines will double every 7 days they go unpaid.

On a lighter note, this Friday looks like it's going to be a lot of fun. Keep pubbing hard though so we don't have another toga party pls.

We have lots of exciting events coming up in the next few weeks, and we need your help to make sure everything runs smoothly. Expect lots of emails this weekend with the details!

yours in the euphoria,
SXS and AWW
