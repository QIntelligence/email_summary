Hey Will,

Dominick DeLucia here. I'm friends with Olivia Joslin, and I'm co-founder of a web-based travel startup called Exploriac. I'm a Junior Stats concentrator at Harvard right now and my co-founder is an entrepreneurship and marketing major at Bucknell. I've been trying to find a CTO for this project for a while, but unfortunately the Harvard CS scene hasn't been very receptive. We're in the middle of developing version 1.0 of our web platform right now with a target release date at the end of April. 

I'm reaching out to you because Olivia told me you may have some contacts in the programming/development scene over at MIT. I'm trying to get intros with some talented CS students and make inroads to get a CTO on board our founder team and create a small, core development team. As a little bit about the idea, we are designing this site to be the first, true social media for travel so that people can share their journeys and experiences, not just singular moments. The platform is designed for travelers to weave stories through photos and videos of their experiences, and the site is organized so that aspiring travelers can utilize the crowd-sourced knowledge of similarly interested explorers all around the globe in order to plan their own travel. The ultimate goal of Exploriac is to use the specialized travel social media platform to empower travelers to discover, book, and share their travel experiences all in one place as the travel agent for the internet generation. Admittedly, it's a huge idea and a daunting endeavor, but I think we have a great plan to make some serious waves in the online travel industry. 

If you could be of any assistance in making connections to individuals in the MIT computer science community, I'd be greatly appreciative. Additionally, if you have any interest in learning some more about the idea I would be happy to meet sometime to tell you more! 

Very best,

Dominick
